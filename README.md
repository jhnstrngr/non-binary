# non-binary - is gender binary?
## This project was simply meant to inspire thought and possibly teach people something new about gender.
To run simply download the project and run the index.html or browse it on:
http://www.isgender.io or https://dazzling-ptolemy-2bc59e.netlify.com/

To use, simply allow the website access to use your camera and be in a good position for it to see your face. Then it will tell you what gender it thinks you are based on a trained API model. **May require an modern and up to date browser such as FireFox or Google Chrome.**

Made using face-api.js, javascript, html and scss.
