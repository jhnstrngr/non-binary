      <div class="quote">"Gender refers to the roles, behaviours, activities, attributes and opportunities that any society considers appropriate for girls and boys, and women and men. Gender interacts with, but is different from, the binary categories of biological sex."</div>
      <div class="source">- <a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/gender">World Health Organization</a></div>
    </div>

  <div class="storyText" data-aos="fade">Typically missunderstood for birth sex. Gender are the expectations society has set on the sexes. Often viewed as stereotypes, that things like clothes, hobbies, sports and professions are given. Think about examples such as makeup, dresses, rugby and nurses which are typically associated with either men or women.</div>  

  <div class="storyText" data-aos="fade">If a trained AI doesn't find it as simple as true or false to figure out what someone's gender is, then maybe gender is a little bit more complicated than a lot of people think.</div>

  <div class="storyText" data-aos="fade">Feel free to test this using images of people on your phone. You'll notice when using photos of people who are famously gender ambigous, they will typically not be predicted correctly. Try the famous <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=rupaul">RuPaul</a> in Drag for instance.</div>

      <div class="source">- <a href="https://www.lexico.com/en/definition/sex">Oxford Dictionary</a></div>
    </div>

    <div class="storyText" data-aos="fade">Although the sexes are typically binary, it's important to note that a lot of what we associete with the sexes are just societal constructs. This is why the term non-binary is increasingly growing in popularity as people are no longer associating with a lot of their societal expectations.</div>
